# LeetCode Solutions
  1. Currently working on Version 2 of my LeetCode Practice Problems library, problems I have completed
  2. Version 1 was all HTML/CSS, I have converted everything mostly JavaScript and jQuery
  3. I am using Bootstrap4 to design my this project due to how quick and simple bootstrap is. I am also using some CSS

# Current Goal for this project
  1. Redesign this project to help keep better track of algorithm solutions I have created from LeetCode
  
# Long Term Goal
  1. My Long term goal for this project is to build a library of algorithms I have solved that I can keep track of using this repository. 
  2. By using this, I can keep track of how I have solved algorithms over the course of my Web Development career and see areas in which I can improve.
